## RealTimeHub

This is a demo app for simulating and testing real-time, event-driven features powered by Socket.IO. It includes functionality like end-to-end encrypted private chatting and live classroom interactions.

## Goal

Would love for this project to become a collection of real-world implementations of real-time features â€” empowering beginners to learn freely and confidently.

## Warning

Please bear with me, I know the document is ugly, kinda busy ðŸ˜„...

# CONTRIBUTIONS

argument: "message-id"

event name: "chat-user-typing",
argument: "receiver-id", {} // from user data

event name: "chat-user-stopped-typing",
argument: "receiver-id", {} // from user data

private chat events you can listen to

event name: "chat-message-read"
